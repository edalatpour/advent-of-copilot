# 🎄 Advent of Copilot

Welcome to **Advent of Copilot** — a companion repository for the YouTube series on the channel **[@advent-of-copilot](https://www.youtube.com/@advent-of-copilot)**.

This project explores how to use **GitHub Copilot** to solve the daily programming challenges from **Advent of Code 2025**. Each episode focuses on a different Copilot capability, from autocomplete and inline comments to Copilot Chat, the Coding Agent, and even running multiple agents in parallel.

> **Important:**  
> This series is *not* intended to teach programming fundamentals.  
> If you're learning to code, I strongly recommend completing at least one full year of Advent of Code **without** GitHub Copilot first.  
> Once you’ve built that foundation, this series will show you how Copilot can accelerate your workflow and help you think, code, and ship faster.
