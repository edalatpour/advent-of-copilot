🎄 Avent of Copilot — Episode 1 Script

“What Is GitHub Copilot? And Why Advent of Code Is the Perfect Playground”

[OPENING — HOOK]

ON CAMERA

“AI programming tools like GitHub Copilot are changing the way developers write code — but what does that actually mean in practice? And how do you learn to use them effectively without getting overwhelmed?”

Beat.

“In this series, I’m going to explore how GitHub Copilot works by using Advent of Code, a collection of small programming puzzles that can be solved using any language you like.”

Avent of Copilot — Episode 1: What Is GitHub Copilot?

---

[SECTION 1 — WHAT GITHUB COPILOT IS]

ON CAMERA

“Before we dive into puzzles, let’s talk about GitHub Copilot itself — because that’s the real star of this series.”

“GitHub Copilot is an AI coding assistant built right into your development workflow. It helps you write code faster, explore new ideas, and automate the repetitive parts of programming.”

“It can autocomplete entire functions, explain code, generate tests, help you debug, and even collaborate with you through chat or the Coding Agent. Think of it like pair‑programming with a teammate who’s always available, always patient, and surprisingly good at remembering syntax.”

“But — and this is important — Copilot is not a replacement for learning how to code. It’s a power tool. It amplifies your skills, but it doesn’t create them.”

[SECTION 2 — A CLEAR DISCLAIMER ABOUT LEARNING]

ON CAMERA

“So if you’re watching this because you want to learn programming from scratch, I want to set expectations.”

“Using GitHub Copilot to solve coding puzzles won’t teach you the fundamentals. In fact, if you’re trying to build your skills, I strongly recommend doing at least one full year of Advent of Code without Copilot.”

“Struggle with the logic. Make mistakes. Look things up. That’s how you grow.”

“Then — once you’ve built that foundation — come back to this series. Because that’s when Copilot becomes a superpower.”

[SECTION 3 — WHY ADVENT OF CODE IS THE PERFECT PLAYGROUND]

“Now, let’s talk about Advent of Code — because this is the playground we’re going to use to explore what Copilot can do.”

“Advent of Code is a yearly programming event that runs from December 1st through December 25th. Every day, a new puzzle drops. You get a story, an input file, and a problem to solve. Solve part one, and you unlock part two — usually a twist that forces you to rethink your approach.”

“It’s language‑agnostic, it’s fun, and it’s a great way to practice problem‑solving.”

“And for our purposes, it’s perfect. Each puzzle is self‑contained, increasingly challenging, and gives us a clean way to demonstrate different Copilot features.”

[SECTION 4 — HOW THIS SERIES WILL USE ADVENT OF CODE TO TEACH COPILOT]

ON CAMERA

“So here’s how this series works.”

“We’re going to take Advent of Code puzzles and use them as a fun, structured way to explore GitHub Copilot’s capabilities.”

“Each episode focuses on a different Copilot skill:

• writing code with autocomplete
• using inline comments
• feeding Copilot the entire problem description
• solving puzzles with Copilot Chat
• letting the Copilot Coding Agent build the solution and open a pull request
• customizing Copilot’s behavior
• and even running multiple agents in parallel to solve multiple days at once.”


“These puzzles give us a perfect sandbox — not because Advent of Code requires AI, but because it gives us a consistent, real‑world context to show how Copilot can help you think, code, and ship faster.”

[SECTION 5 — TODAY’S GOAL: SOLVE DAY 1 BY HAND]

SCREENSHARE: OPEN DAY 1 PUZZLE

“Today, though, we’re starting simple. I’m going to solve the Day 1 puzzle completely on my own — no Copilot, no hints, no AI.”

“This gives us a baseline. It shows what the puzzle looks like when you tackle it manually, and it sets the stage for how Copilot will accelerate things in the next episodes.”

(You walk through the Day 1 solution once the 2025 puzzle is released.)

[SECTION 6 — WRAP-UP]

ON CAMERA

“And that’s Episode 1. We’ve talked about what GitHub Copilot is, why Advent of Code is the perfect playground, and why this series is about learning Copilot, not learning to code.”

“In Episode 2, we’ll start using Copilot’s autocomplete and inline suggestions to solve Day 2 faster — and you’ll see just how much time it saves.”

“This is Avent of Copilot. I’ll see you in the next episode.”

• a teleprompter‑optimized version
• a version with B‑roll cues
• a version with jokes or personality beats
• or a version tailored to your GitHub sales storytelling style
